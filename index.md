## Welcome to GitHub Pages

I am an assistant professor in the [Department of Computer Science](https://di.ku.dk/english/) at the [University of Copenhagen](https://www.ku.dk/english/). 

I received my PhD in Electrical Engineering from the Department of Automatic Control at the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science of KTH Royal Institute of Technology under the supervision of Alexandre Proutiere and Mikael Johansson. After my PhD, I spent two wonderful years at SequeL team of Inria Lille-Nord Europe, as a post-doctoral researcher working with Odalric-Ambrym Maillard.

I received my BSc degree in Electrical Engineering (minor: Electronics) from Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST) in 2004, and my MSc degree in Electrical Engineering (minor: Communication Systems) from Sharif University of Technology in 2006. Prior to starting my PhD, I worked a few years as a research engineer in the School of Computer Science of Institute for Research in Fundamental Sciences (IPM).


My research interests include:
- Theoretical aspects of reinforcement learning
- Markov decision processes
- Stochastic multi-armed bandits
- Resource allocation in networks
